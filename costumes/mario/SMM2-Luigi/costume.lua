    Author's Notes and some Kewl Stuff, I Guess:
    
    If you wanna reuse this, modify it, or do whatever with it, do it! Just make sure to give credit to both me and all of the people listed above.
    
    Whew. This took a lot of work. Like, I spent four or so days straight just making sprites, sprites, and more sprites. But, hey. Toadette's FINALLY playable in a non-janky way!
    I seriously recommend checking out the Tanooki sprite sheet. Not a single frame there is empty! I really learned a lot about how SMBX works doing this.
    
    I plan on making versions for Mario, Luigi, and Toad, too, so be on the lookout for those!
    
    If you catch any bugs, misalignments, or other gaffes, go ahead and tell me immediately! Whether it's through a DM or a reply to the thread, I'll make sure to check!
    
    If there's any "optimize this later" stuff in the code, then I apologize. I really need to get around to cleaning that up.

    Anyways, that's all. I seriously hope that you enjoy playing as these guys as much as I did making them!
    
    By the way, I should probably make something clear. If you wanna reuse literally any of this code, then go for it! If it's a large amount of code, though, don't forget to give credit.
    
    v1.1: Toadette now has a unique animation that plays if you jump while under the effects of a Super Star.
    I figured this would be a good animation to test out, and, given that it works, I'm sure that Toadette and the other characters are going to get a lot of polish as time goes on.
    I'm prooooooobably going to start prioritizing the other characters now, heh.
    
    v1.2: Toad's done! Nice! I'm pretty glad I got him out, since it actually helped me spot a few errors in Toadette's sprites, including a few that I... forgot to document. Oh, well.
    Plus, working on alternate physics was really fun, and I use them all the time now. I might as well give a brief explanation as to why I made them.
    
    You see, SMBX's physics are strange. Instead of making your jump speed relate to the speed you started the jump with, SMBX just polls for your speed every frame and derives your
    jump speed from that. It's super annoying, and has actually gotten me killed while trying to jump onto high ledges quite a few times. Also, bouncing off of an enemy doesn't give
    you max height, and trampolines can give you varying height depending on how fast you're moving. This costume's alternate physics fix these problems, and make jumping in SMBX
    feel more in line with actual Mario games without sacrificing compatibility. At least, I hope.
    
    v1.3: Victory animations! Woot! I've been looking forwards to implementing these into the game, heh. Seeing the victory sprites go unused for so long was a real bummer.
    Thankfully, though, they're finally here. I even got to implement SMA4's World-e victory flip! It looks really smooth, and, to be honest, it's the real reason that the
    star flip frames are here. Also, good lord, getting the SMW animation to work correctly was painful. You see, while I already had animations figured out by now, graphical
    effects weren't really in my domain. In particular, I spent a while trying to get an iris working on my own before just stealing code from warpTransition.lua. From there,
    I had a lot of work to do, like creating an iris effect for the three "magic orb" victory animations, handling victory animations that I'm not supposed to modify, and
    even correcting certain sprites. You see, Toad and Toadette actually received an update to their "failure" sprites in between the SMB3 and NSMB sheets. The problem with
    this is that it meant that I had to manually adjust, like, all of the sprites that weren't already modified. It wasn't really too hard, though, and taught me a little bit
    about how shading works, not that I'll really ever get to use that information. Still, the coding I had to do for this update was preeeeeetty tricky, so I'm glad to have it out.
    Anyways, there's a certain plumber who's been calling my name, so I need to go and update his sprites. More on why I'm saying "update" and not just "set up" after I'm done. ;)
    
    v1.4: Go, Weegee! Luigi's finally made his highly awaited entry into this costume pack! So, I might as well follow up on what I said last update. You see, I actually made Luigi before I even made Toadette.
    Since he didn't have as many extra frames as her, he made for good practice, and helped me ease into the process of managing sprites. Since I already had these sprites, all I needed to do was add a few more
    and I was all set! It's a good thing, too, since it meant that I could get Luigi out as soon as a day after the previous update. Now that I'm done with Luigi, I'm not sure whether I'm going to add Mario
    or focus on giving these characters proper Goomba Shoe sprites, since they'd probably be pretty nice to have. Whatever. I just hope I don't slow down a ton once I'm off of winter break. Oh, and, uh,
    I hope you enjoy the upcoming New Year! Just putting that up there in case I don't get another update out before then.
    
    v1.5: Let's-a go! Mario's here to complete the SMM2 Crew! It feels really nice being able to say that, ha. Now, in case you didn't carefully and deliberately thumb through all of my update posts, this is
    ABSOLUTELY NOT the end of the project. In fact, there is a LOT more that I want to do with it, and that's something that I hope I've been very ***vocal*** about. Regardless, though, seeing all four folders
    just sitting together makes me so happy. Plus, Mario was actually the easiest to do because I did him after finding a paint.net plugin that Enjl made that should REALLY, REALLY be stickied. I have no idea
    why it's not. Basically, it automatically mirrors your sprites for you, meaning that you don't have to worry about doing it manually. This cut down the time it took to implement Mario's sprites by, like,
    two thirds. If it wasn't for all the festivities, chances are, I'd have had him out by the end of New Year's Eve. Unfortunately, it wasn't meant to be. Oh, also, state-dependent death sprites! I've waited for
    so long to implement these, it's not even funny. I've always found it super cool when people made these sprites, since having only Small form death sprites becomes a bit more distracting after you've played
    games like New Super Mario Bros. games. Also, to the four of you besides myself who voted, I sincerely want to say thank you. You guys seriously rock!
    
    v1.6: Spin to win! Update v1.6 is here with subtler improvements to keep your gameplay experience bumpin'! Or, rather, spinning. I know, this isn't what I was alluding to earlier, but I figured that 
    this was pretty important. Anyways, this one's really focused on not only housekeeping and adding gameplay features that I've always wanted to add since day one, but also some features that the people 
    who replied to the thread wanted. PixelHoyte and MECHDRAGON777, this update goes out to the two of you! Oh, and don't worry, TheGameyFireBro105. You'll get your time to shine once I finish the Super Acorn,
    which should be soon, since I finally finished getting this update out. I went ahead and not only added an adjustable blacklist for the custom victory animations that defaultly supports MrDoubleA's custom exits,
    but also made things a little bit less hardcoded, just so that changing the character any of these costumes are applied to is now possible without having to adjust the code. File renaming is still required, but that's
    kind of a given, so it shouldn't be a problem. On a less compatibility-oriented note, Spin Jumping got a major visual overhaul. You now spin at a 50% faster rate, closer to SMM2's animation, and your held item now 
    moves around a lot more. Furthermore, you now bounce off of enemies at your maximum height, so Spin Jumping off of stuff is way more satisfying. Ultimately, Spin Jumping just... feels better. Oh, and I also 
    added Yellow Toad, but I really don't think people care about him. If you do care about him, then please do check out the poll I put up with the release of this update. 
    
    Seriously, thanks for everything, everybody. This project would've never made it so far if it wasn't for your everlasting support, and I'm looking forwards to continuing work on it!
    
    v1.7: I'm still here! This update might be a bit smaller in terms of content, but it's still pretty important. It fixes a lot of bugs that I just sort of... forgot about, most notably the fact that everybody's
    falling animation was misaligned. It wasn't until GlacialSiren484 pointed everything out to me that I fixed it all, actually. I'm a bit upset that I let this go on for so long even though I knew *something* was
    wrong with the falling animation, but I'm just glad that I have it fixed now. Anyways, swimming. Lots of people hate it, and I know why: the lack of control. Okay, I guess the speed at which you move is an important
    factor, too, but that's a crucial part of swimming mechanics. At least, I think. I should really check at some point. Anyways, the point is, that would require levels to be redesigned, so it's not top priority. What
    I *can* do, however, is make movement on the y axis - the axis you're *supposed* to have more control over - feel much better. In other words, SMW swimming *actually* returns! SMBX swimming honestly kind of... sucks.
    The rate at which you can swim is actually capped, making it a very dissatisfying experience. Thankfully, changing that is as easy as constantly setting a value in the player's memory to 0. I also went ahead and
    added an option to bring back the tan that everybody gets in Fire and Hammer form, since Glacial asked me about it over Discord. It looks nice, though it was definitely harder to implement than I thought it would be.
    So, yeah. Just so you guys know, I've been working on the Penguin Suit in the background. I'm going to try my best to get it out before spring (in the nothern hemisphere), since it would be really unfitting if I didn't.
    I'll see you guys in the next update!
